Ghost Shell also known as the shell is a simple command line prompt that takes the most basics of commands that
are present in the bash shell and runs them. This shell was built as a project for Holberton School.

the shell works like the bash and other basic shells.

The shell works by being compiled using GCC 4.8.5 compiler or later versions. The shell can compile using gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell.
