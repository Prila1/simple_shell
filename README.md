Ghost Shell also known as the shell is a simple command line prompt that takes the most basics of commands that
are present in the bash shell and runs them. This shell was built as a project for Holberton School.

the shell works like the bash and other basic shells.

The shell works by being compiled using GCC 4.8.5 compiler or later versions. The shell can compile using gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell.


Exiting commands and the shell
To exit out of a command or process the user can use ctrl c. Control c stops a process and causes it to abort. The user can also utilize the command ctrl D which will just exit. When the command ctrl D is used an exit status of 0 is given. Using exit, you can input its exit status or it is defaulted to the status of the last command executed.
